      <h3>What is DPN?</h3>
      <div id='tribute-info'>

        <p>Deaf President Now was a watershed event; prior to the events of March 6-13, 1988 Jerry C. Lee stepped down as the
          6th president of the University. This set off a search for a new president. The Board of Trustees had narrowed
          it down to 3 candidates. Two were deaf- I.King Jordan & Harvey Corson and one hearing- Elisabeth Zinser. The ultimate
          choice of the Board is what set off the week of DPN- and grabbed the world's attention.
        </p>
        <!--<p> -->
        A Brief Timeline of the events:
        <ul class='timeline'>
          <li class='day1'>
            Day 1 (March 6)</li>
          <p> Sunday evening. The Board of Trustees had the University's Public Relations Office distribute press releases 1.5
            hours before the time many had expected. The press release stated that the chosen candidate was Dr. Elisabeth
            Zinser who was the sole hearing candidate of the 3.</p>
          <p>Once the news was known, reaction were of disbelief and anger. Eventually Gary Olsen, then the president of NAD
            encouraged the crowd of students to head to the MayFlower Hotel where the Board of Trustees had been meeting--
            since they did not come to the campus to make themselves available, they decided to march to the hotel to demand
            some answers regarding their decision.
          </p>
          <p>Attempts to speak with the Board Chair Jane Spilman did not go well- students decided to stand firm. As a result
            Spilman agreed to come to the campus to discuss the situation further the next day.
          </p>

          <li class='day2'>Day 2 (March 7)</li>
          <p>After much planning, the first of the protests began with students blocking each of the entrances to the campus
            with cars and deflating the tires. They also prevented many Adminstrators from walking onto the campus though
            they did allow many staff and faculty to pass.</p>
          <p>Upon the arrival of Spilman and other Board members, they were presented with a list of four demands. After a meeting
            that lasted more than 3 hours, Spilman stated that all 4 demands were rejected and that the appointment of Zinser
            would stand.
          </p>
          <p>Just before the announcement to the students, someone got up on stage and announced that they did not accept any
            of the 4 demands. This prompted, and was encouraged by many, the students to walk out. They proceeded to march
            to the US Capitol- where more rallies and speeches occourred.
          </p>
          <p>By this point the protest had made front page news in Washington DC and local TV stations descended upon the campus.
          </p>

          <li class='day3'>Day 3 (March 8)</li>
          <p> The gates were reopened to allow people to come and go however students boycotted classes and continued to attend
            rallies. Meanwhile the faculty convened a meeting of their own to decide what to do.</p>
          <p> 4 students- Bridgetta Bourne, Gregory Hlibok, Jerry Covell and Tim Rarus- became the visible leaders of the protest
            while many worked tirelessly behind the scenes.</p>
          <p>By this time the news had spread across the nation and was featured on national telelvision programs.</p>
          </li>

          <li class='day4'>Day 4 (March 9)</li>
          <p> Many meetings occurred including one between the student leaders and 2 Congressmen; two Congressmen and one Senator
            are regularly appointed to the Board of Trustees. I. King Jordan, one of the deaf candidates, gave his support
            to Dr. Zinser while many- including the Congressmen- urged Zinser to resign.</p>
          <p> Greg Hlibok, one of the student leaders, Marlee Matlin- actress and Elisabeth Zinser appeared on ABC's Nightline
            hosted by Ted Koppell (it was quite contentious).
          </p>

          <li class='day5'>Day 5 (March 10)</li>
          <p> Rallies continued through the day. Greg Hlibok appeared on Good Morning America. Student once again blocked the
            gates- with hot-wired school busses this time and flattend the tires because of rumors that Spilman and Zinser
            would try to force their way onto campus. </p>
          <p>I. King Jordan retracted his support of Zinser and aligned himself with the protesters after much thought and reflection.
            Support from all around the US including from the American Postal Workers Union poured in. That night Zinser
            announced her resignation.
          </p>

          <li class='day6'>Day 6 (March 11)</li>
          <p>Celebrations- 3 1/2 demands to go. Still much work to do. Students again marched to the US Capitol (this time with
            proper permits!). Many vowed to stay on campus for Spring Break to keep the momentum of the protest going. </p>

          <li class='day7'>Day 7 (March 12)</li>
          <p> A day of rest- a break from the intensity of the previous week.</p>

          <li class='day8'>Day 8 (March 13)</li>
          <p> Board Members who had gone home, traveled back to DC to meet again. After an all day meeting, it was announced
            that the final 3 demands were met and that I. King Jordan was named the 8th president of Gallaudet University
            (Zinser was technically the 7th).</p>
